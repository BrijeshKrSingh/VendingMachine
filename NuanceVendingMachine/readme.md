Assumptions:

- Assuming that machine is already having enough change as requirements don't ask to maintain machine's coins
- Authentication and Authorization are not in the scope
- Sales coins are not being maintained 
- Assuming, if item is not in stock then it should not be visible to users
- Didn't work much on look and feel of the application but it should be working functional properly
- Added both bonus points
- Didn't write few unit test cases (already written 18) but used Moq and xunit framework to showcase the procedure to write unit test case
- Assuming, exception handling is not in the scope hence you might see very few exception handling
